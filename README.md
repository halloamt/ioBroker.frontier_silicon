## Documentation

This adapter lets you control internet radios and media players based on Frontier Silicon chipsets. Many devices which can be controlled via [Undok](https://www.frontiersmart.com/undok) should work. Tested devices come from [Revo](https://revo.co.uk/de/products/), [Sangean](https://www.sangean.eu/products/all_product.asp) and [SilverCrest](https://www.silvercrest-multiroom.de/produkte/produktuebersicht/), others should work, too.

After installation the device's IP and PIN must be entered in the configuration dialog. If the radio does not play DAB after switching on via Undok or this adapter try with "DAB starts without sound" enabled.

When the adapter starts for the first time it collects information about the device. For that it needs to switch through all modes. During checking settings the device will be muted for a few seconds to avoid disturbing sounds.

While the adapter reads the device's setting objects and states are created. States can be read-only (`ro`) or read-write (`rw`) *ok, write-only for buttons is also possible*.

- audio

  Basic audio settings. No equalizer controls implemented yet.

  - maxVolume (`number, ro`)

    The maximum volume selectable

  - mute (`boolean, rw`)

    `true` if the device is muted, `false`otherwise

  - volume (`number, rw`)
  - control
    - volumeDown and volumeUp

    In-/ or decreases volume by 1

- device

  - friendlyName (`text, rw`)
  - power (`boolean, rw`)
  - radioId (`test, ro`)

    My guess is that this is the MAC of the device

  - version (`text, ro`)

    Software version

  - webfsapi (`text, ro`)

    The address of the API

- info

  - connection (`boolean, ro`)

    Connection indicator for the adapter

- media

  - state (`number, rw`)

    valid values are:
    - 0: Pause
    - 1: Play

  - control

    - next
    - plause
    - play
    - previous

  Do not take the following names too seriously. The radio uses them differently in different modes.

  - album (`text, ro`)
  - artist (`text, ro`)
  - graphic (`text, ro`)

    Use this URL to get an album cover or a station's logo.

  - name (`text, ro`)
  - text (`text, ro`)
  - title (`text, ro`)

- modes

  - readPresets

    Re-reads all presets

  - selectPreset (`number, rw`)

    Used to get or select a preset. Be warned that the adapter guesses as this value cannot be read from the API.

  - selected (`number, rw`)

    Indicates or selects the selected mode. Can also be selected via `modes.{number}.switchTo`

  - `{number}`

    - id (`text, ro`)

      The name of that mode

    - key (`number, ro`)

      The index of that mode. Equals `mode.{number}` from object tree and can be written into `modes.selected`.

    - selectable (`boolean, ro`)

      `true` if this mode can be manually selected.

    - streamable (`boolean, ro`)

      Only present on multi-room enabled devices. `true` if this mode can be used as source for several multi-room devices.
  
    - switchTo

      Selects that mode.

    - presets

      - availabe (`boolean, ro`)

        Indicates whether presets for this mode are available

      - `{number}`

        The index of that preset. Equals `mode.*.presets.{number}.key`.

        - key

          The index of that preset. Equals `mode.*.presets.{number}` from object tree and can be written into `modes.selectPreset`.

        - name (`text, ro`)

          The name of that preset

        - switchTo

          Selects that preset and the corresponding mode.

Please be aware that you can sometimes choose between "pushing a button" or "setting a value". Use what is more convenient for you.
