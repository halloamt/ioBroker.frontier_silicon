## Info

Provides support for media players, internet radios and SmartRadios equipped with a Frontier Silicon chipset using FSAPI.

NOTE: This adapter has been transferred to iobroker-community-adapters for maintenance. Thus planned features (see below) will not be implemented. Only important bug fixes and dependency updates will be released in the future. However PRs with bug fixes or feature enhancements are always welcome.

RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.1.x includes some Breaking Changes:

- node>=14, js-contoller>=4 and admin>=5 required

Upgrade your ioBroker to at least this software level, if you want to use this adapter

- PIN encryption and validity check of all parameters in config UI
If you update this adapter from a previous version instead of a new installation, the adapter will not start, even if your PIN in your config is correct and has not been changed. To fix this, simply enter the same previous PIN once more in the config UI and store and close the config UI to restart the adapter. This of course is only neccessary once after the first start after the update.

- The type of "frontier_silicon.X.modes.selectPreset" changed from "string" to "number"
If you update this adapter from a previous version instead of a new installation, you may possibly find warnings in the ioBroker log like:
`State value to set for "frontier_silicon.0.modes.selectPreset" has to be type "string" but received type "number"`
To prevent this from happening, the most simple solution is to stop the adapter in the instances tab of ioBroker, completely delete the object tree in the objects tab and then restart the adapter. This of course is only neccessary once after the update and is not required if you do a clean new installation.

- Synchronization of power, volume and mute states with the UNDOK App
Synchronization with the UNDOK App here means that power, volume and mute settings changed by the UNDOK App will now also be updated in the states of this adapter.  Due to the limitations of the FSAPI protocol the state synchronization of the UNDOK App with the adapter still is unreliable and will not be instantaneous but only happen when e.g. a preset or a mode is changed using the UNDOK App.

## Features

### Implemented features

- Power control
- Mode selection
- Preset selection
- Notifications for several states
- Volume control
- Notifications

### Planned features

- Auto discovery
- More states
- Translations
- More Exception handling
- Cleaner code
- Multi room features

### Not planned features

- Changing system information

### Known Bugs and Limitations

- The Media player must be on for preset discovery
- Due to limitations of the FSAPI protocol, parallel operation with the UNDOK App is not reliable and thus not supported. Use at own risk.

## Documentation

This adapter lets you control internet radios and media players based on Frontier Silicon chipsets. Many devices which can be controlled via [UNDOK](https://support.undok.net) should work. Tested devices come from [Revo](https://revo.co.uk/de/products/), [Sangean](https://www.sangean.eu/products/all_product.asp), [Hama](https://de.hama.com/produkte/audio-hifi/digitalradio) and [SilverCrest](https://www.lidl.de), others should work, too.

After installation the device's IP and PIN must be entered in the configuration dialog. If the radio does not play DAB after switching on via the UNDOK App or this adapter try again with "DAB starts without sound" enabled.

When the adapter starts for the first time it collects information about the device. For that it needs to switch through all modes. During checking settings the device will be muted for a few seconds to avoid disturbing sounds.

While the adapter reads the device's settings ioBroker objects and states are created. States can be read-only (`ro`) or read-write (`rw`) *ok, write-only for buttons is also possible*.

- audio

  Basic audio settings. No equalizer controls implemented yet.

  - maxVolume (`number, ro`)

    The maximum volume selectable

  - mute (`boolean, rw`)

    `true` if the device is muted, `false`otherwise

  - volume (`number, rw`)
  - control
    - volumeDown and volumeUp

    In-/ or decreases volume by 1

- device

  - friendlyName (`text, rw`)
  - power (`boolean, rw`)
  - radioId (`test, ro`)

    My guess is that this is the MAC of the device

  - version (`text, ro`)

    Software version

  - webfsapi (`text, ro`)

    The address of the API

- info

  - connection (`boolean, ro`)

    Connection indicator for the adapter

- media

  - state (`number, rw`)

    valid values are:
    - 0: Pause
    - 1: Play

  - control

    - next
    - plause
    - play
    - previous

  Do not take the following names too seriously. The radio uses them differently in different modes.

  - album (`text, ro`)
  - artist (`text, ro`)
  - graphic (`text, ro`)

    Use this URL to get an album cover or a station's logo.

  - name (`text, ro`)
  - text (`text, ro`)
  - title (`text, ro`)

- modes

  - readPresets

    Re-reads all presets

  - selectPreset (`number, rw`)

    Used to get or select a preset. Be warned that the adapter guesses as this value cannot be read from the API.

  - selected (`number, rw`)

    Indicates or selects the selected mode. Can also be selected via `modes.{number}.switchTo`

  - `{number}`

    - id (`text, ro`)

      The name of that mode

    - key (`number, ro`)

      The index of that mode. Equals `mode.{number}` from object tree and can be written into `modes.selected`.

    - selectable (`boolean, ro`)

      `true` if this mode can be manually selected.

    - streamable (`boolean, ro`)

      Only present on multi-room enabled devices. `true` if this mode can be used as source for several multi-room devices.
  
    - switchTo

      Selects that mode.

    - presets

      - availabe (`boolean, ro`)

        Indicates whether presets for this mode are available

      - `{number}`

        The index of that preset. Equals `mode.*.presets.{number}.key`.

        - key

          The index of that preset. Equals `mode.*.presets.{number}` from object tree and can be written into `modes.selectPreset`.

        - name (`text, ro`)

          The name of that preset

        - switchTo

          Selects that preset and the corresponding mode.

Please be aware that you can sometimes choose between "pushing a button" or "setting a value". Use what is more convenient for you.
